## 📖 About

This project is a modern AI-powered web app for detecting and classifying clothing in images. It leverages TensorFlow.js and pre-trained models (COCO-SSD, MobileNet) to analyze photos directly in the browser. The interface is clean, responsive, and user-friendly.

### 💡 Purpose

To provide a simple, accessible tool for clothing detection and classification using AI, all running client-side in the browser. Great for demos, learning, and experimentation with computer vision.

## 🧐 What's Inside?

- 🖼️ **Image Upload**: Upload and analyze your own photos
- 🤖 **AI Detection**: Detects clothing, accessories, and people
- 📊 **Detailed Results**: Shows detected items, confidence, and bounding boxes
- 📱 **Responsive UI**: Works on desktop and mobile
- 📝 **No Backend**: All processing is done in the browser

## ⚡️ Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- No installation required for demo

### 🚀 Local Usage

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No build step needed.

## ⚠️ Important: How to Run This Project

> **Note:** You cannot simply double-click `index.html` to run this app because browser security restrictions will prevent the AI models from loading locally. You must serve the project with a local or remote web server.

### 🖥️ Recommended Ways to Run

#### 1. VS Code (Recommended)
- Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension.
- Right-click `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.
- The app will open in your browser and models will load correctly.

#### 2. JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm, PhpStorm, etc.)
- Right-click `index.html` and choose **"Open in Browser"** (JetBrains IDEs automatically serve files over HTTP).
- Alternatively, use the built-in web server feature.

#### 3. Command Line (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Python 3** (cross-platform):
  ```sh
  python -m http.server 8000
  # Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
  ```
- **Node.js (http-server)**:
  ```sh
  npx http-server .
  # Then open the shown URL (usually http://localhost:8080)
  ```
- **PHP (if installed):**
  ```sh
  php -S localhost:8000
  # Then open http://localhost:8000
  ```

> Do not use the `file://` protocol (double-clicking the file) — models will not load!

## 📚 Features

- Fast, client-side AI detection
- Modern and clean UI
- No data leaves your device
- Supports JPG, PNG, GIF images (up to 10MB)
- Visualizes detection results with bounding boxes and labels
